  abstract = {Collaboration increasingly takes place in virtual communities using
	the Internet. These communities are socio-technical systems that
	tend to evolve strongly and become more complex over time. To ensure
	that changes to these complex socio-technical systems are meaningful
	and acceptable to the community as a whole, the relevant members
	of the community need to be involved in their specification. The
	RENISYS method conceptualizes community specification processes as
	conversations for specification by relevant members. It supports
	this process in two steps. First, it uses formal composition norms
	to select the relevant community members who need to be involved
	in a particular conversation for specification. It then uses a formal
	model of conversations for specification to determine the acceptable
	conversational moves that the selected community members can make,
	as well as the status of their responsibilities and accomplishments
	at each point in time. By combining composition norms with conversations
	for specification, the specification processes can be precisely tailored
	to the specification support needs of the community.},

  abstract = {At any given time, the stability of a community depends on the right
	balance of trust and distrust. Furthermore, we face information overload,
	increased uncertainty and risk taking as a prominent feature of modern
	living. As members of society, we cope with these complexities and
	uncertainties by relying trust, which is the basis of all social
	interactions. Although a small number of trust models have been proposed
	for the virtual medium, we find that they are largely impractical
	and artificial. In this paper we provide and discuss a trust model
	that is grounded in real-world social trust characteristics, and
	based on a reputation mechanism, or word-of-mouth. Our proposed model
	allows agents to decide which other agents&#039; opinions they trust
	more and allows agents to progressively tune their understanding
	of another agent&#039;s subjective recommendations.},

	and various paradigms which span on broad CDNs areas. Therefore,
	aspects of CDNs in terms of basics, design process, practice, techniques,
	performances, platforms, applications, and experimental results have
	been presented in a proper order. Fundamental methods, initiatives,
	significant research results, as well as references for further study
	have also been provided. Comparison of different design and development
	approaches are described at the appropriate places so that new researchers
	as well as advanced practitioners can use the CDNs evaluation as
	a research roadmap. All the contributions have been reviewed, edited,
	processed, and placed in the appropriate order to maintain consistency
	so that any reader irrespective of their level of knowledge and technological
	skills in CDNs would get the most out of it. The book is organized
	into three parts, namely, Part I: CDN Fundamentals; Part II: CDN
	Modeling and Performance; and Part III: Advanced CDN Platforms and
	Applications. The organization ensures the smooth flow of material
	as successive chapters build on prior ones. 700 1 $aPathan, Mukaddim$eEditor$4edt
